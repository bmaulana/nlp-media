# nlp-media
A project to use NLP and sentiment analysis to analyse media representations of people with disabilities.

Set up environment: Requires conda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Follow instructions in 'ENV SETUP INSTRUCTIONS' to set up a conda environment and install dependencies (e.g. SpaCy, TensorFlow).

Then, download 'model' folder from https://github.com/openai/generating-reviews-discovering-sentiment, copy to root of this project and rename to 'openai_model'. (Too big to upload to GitHub)

To run: 'python pipeline.py' in cmd/sh (while within the conda env, otherwise run 'activate <env-name>' first e.g 'activate nlp-media').
